# data-analysis-sample

I put up three of my sampl work I've done in my spare time

- apartments:
    Done in jupyter notebook was data analysis of some housing datasets gotten from zillow, realtor, splitspot and airbnb

- credit:
    This utilizes an automl to predict a dataset and search for better parameters and even go further to add more classification algorithm automatically

- recommender system:
    It has the user recommender system to predict similar users based on a given user profile
    
    It also has the article recommender system where you give a title of an article you want to read and it recommends articles from it's database for you based on the title given.
